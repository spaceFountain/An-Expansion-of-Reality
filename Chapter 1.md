The dripping was really starting to get on Omer’s nervers. There was no reason for it. Despite appearances the Cave wasn’t actually underground. Precisely where it was a subject of some debate, but certainly it was not buried. That water never the less dripped from the ceiling was just one of many of the place’s mysteries. One of the more frustrating mysteries Omer wanted to growl as yet another giant drop of water fell on his already damp hair. 

Just his luck to to get assigned to patrol. How was he meant to know that non-mage had connections. A non-mage with connections. The world was surely going to hell in a handbasket when such a simple mistake would lead to an assignment like this. Omer made yet another pass by the same set of ten stone doors. Each exactly as sealed as they ever had been, exactly as sealed as they  had been for the last thousand years. Still has regulation required Omer dispatched a small part of himself as he passed each to interrogate the guard spell and find if anything had changed. Each time it came back with the same answer Omer’s eyes could see quite well all on their own. Nothing had changed the doors were still barred, the perfect mirror finish was still as unyielding as ever both to light and the more energetic assault of magic. 

Omer was barely paying attention as he trudged back around and made for his 50th inspection of the night. He didn’t quite understand why they still had actual people out doing this. While sure the enchantment on the doors did tend to have a habit of devouring any spell work within reach not to mention the Cave’s own material eroding properties. There was nothing particularly challenging about it even a hundredth mind could have handled it easily and they’d kept hundredth minds stable in far worse. Really, he decided, they must keep it around purely as a punishment, same reason they still had mages cleaning the toilets. Sure magic could handle it, but why not see the privates squirm a bit every now and then. Still really the whole thing should just have been sealed up. It wasn’t like any of the doors were very likely to open. Not after thousands of years of putting up the good fight against everything the republic could throw at them. 

It wasn’t a thought, thousandth minds couldn’t really compose a thought let alone make that thought known to their summoner. It was more of a feeling: something was different. When Omer first sensed it he barely noticed, his thoughts were still flowing through the myriad of unfairnesses that this assignment represented, but deep within his mind one of the of the many sub minds created for just that purpose noticed and escalated the feeling. A thought came swimming up to Omer’s consciousness: It’s open. It wasn’t a particularly complicated thought, but it was enough to shock Omer into almost falling, but he quickly recovered and ] fell into The Standard Contact Presedure that had been drilled into him since his first day at the academy. With a quick glance behind his head, he Confirmed the ward had indeed fallen. The archway opened now onto a plain room. Somebody stood on the other side looking mildly shocked, but Omer didn’t wait to see more. With a series of mental commands he dispatched one of his three half minds feeling the loss of so much of his intellect keenly but he had to Report plus it could well be the only part of him that made it through, better that it was a significant bit than that he had a bit of wit he probably wouldn’t have time to use anyway. In the back of his mind he sensed as it flew away seeking the capital.

Omer quickly dispatched all of his message minds one after another including all the information about the situation that meiger 3rd class artificial minds could hold sending them streaming in different directions for camp. Finally he turned to his real problem; staying alive.

Without hesitating Omer release his shield which sprang into action just between him and the doorway quickly erecting a glowing barrial. It would be hell getting himself stocked up again, but it was for days like this that he’d prepared. Enacting another of his carefully stored he watched as the world around him dimmed to black before swimming back to a fozzy light as the amplification came online. He had about ten minutes or 30 seconds on the outside of accelerated time. Omer planned to be halfway back to camp by the time it ran out. Barely sparing a look back he took off in a jog.

There is only one thing I can report with certainty: that part of the world that we thought to understand was a much poorer and smaller part of the whole than we ever could have imagined. Magic or at least something very much like it is, real. This statement I am sure will strike you as false, the ravings of a madman, or at least a man who has become so thoroughly deluded as to be essentially the same, but it is vitally important that you read this and believe for I fear I have doomed us all.

I will briefly mention my education and background as it is the most easily confirmed part of the story that will follow. On June 20th, 2019 when this story is properly started I was 20, a new college graduate in the field of software engineering. My name is Jonas Black my SSN is 987-65-4323 and I have a PGP key stored under my real name available at https://pgp.mit.edu/. It has been there for many years now so hopefully this will suffice to prove this message indeed comes from me. I put so much effort into this proof, because it is one of the few things I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt. If this is lunacy, it is my lunacy, it is Jonas Black’s lunacy.


Everything really started in July. I had just graduated from college, just gotten my first real job, and just gotten laid off. That morning, technically afternoon, I was woken by someone banging on the the door to my small one room apartment With a sigh I pulled myself up and out of the scattering of blankets and a mattress that served as my bed and pulled on the cloths that were mounded up at it’s base. All the while the pounding continued with increasing urgency. 

When I finally got to the door and was met by the slightly exasperated face of my next door neighbor Amy. “These were starting to become unstable,” she told me with an apologetic shrug as she handed me a pile of mail that had, if I remembered correctly been collecting for at least the last month. It wasn’t really something I wanted to think about, but I took the papers with only the barest of frowns and and mumbled thanks. She started to say something as I was closing the door, but I didn’t quite catch it. 

As I settled to the depressing task of sorting through the mail, one envelope stood out. It was written by hand and as I pulled it out of the pile I noted the thicker more texture paper that set it out as slightly above the average grade. A photocopy of the letter has been included below.

> Dear Mr. Black,

> I hope this finds you well. We have recently become aware that you have inherited some property in Ohio. We would like to apologize for your loss, but caution you that your life may be endangered if you were to visit the property. 
Obviously this can not help but be a strange request. I wish I could prove this fact to you, but sadly that is impossible, instead let me direct you to think critically about anything anyone might tell you and look into your cousin's death.


Crumpling the letter into a ball I was on the point of throwing the spam into the trash when I thought better. Instead shoving it into my back pocket. Maybe I’d figure out what it’s deal was later.

The next five letters were all bills. By the time I came to the last at the bottom of the pile I ripped it open without even pausing to look at the address.

> Mr. Black,

> We’ve never met but I’m your cousin twice removed on your father’s side. I’m sure this letter is unexpected, it took some digging in the genealogy to be sure of this, but it seems my son, your second cousin once removed has left you property in his will. This is as strange for me as it is for you I assure you but as the executive of his wills I’ve been searching for his closest living male relative for the last few months. If you could call me at 311 555-2368 we can try to move forward.

> Sincerely,
Lisa Black

This letter too I was ready to crumple up, but after a moment's thought I changed my mind. Sure it read exactly like a scam, but maybe it was for real. Stranger things had happened. I called the number.  

It took a few rings before anyone picked up, but eventually I heard a rather tired voice on the other end. “Black”

“Hi Mrs. Black,” I said, “this is Jonas Black. You wrote me?”

“Yes Mr Black,” the voice came back with a hint of sadness. 

“Jonas please,” I told her, “I’m so sorry to hear about your son’s passing.”

“It’s OK,” she said in a voice that made it clear that it wasn’t, “It was just so unexpected and then his will.” The shock with hints of betrayal in her voice certainly seemed real enough. I didn’t really know how to react so I didn’t and just listened mute as she continued. “The wills obviously why you’re calling”

“Yea,” I confirmed feeling guilty. I hadn’t even known a second cousin twice removed. 

With an audible breath she pulled herself together. “It was my Grandfather's land befor he died and left it to David. The lands always gone to a man. Dad was old fashioned, but I thought.” She stopped herself. “Anyway, if you want the place you're going to have to come out here. You’re have to at least stand before a judge and you have to visit at least once before you inherit. What’s your email?”

“jonas.e.black@gmail.com,” I told her waiting for her to continue.

“Can you come to the Summit County Probate Court next Monday.” She asked all business now her earlier outburst now if not forgotten at least tightly controlled.

Basically, I was free every day. “What time Monday, and where’s the courthouse”

“Around 1:00 PM I think, I’ll send you all the details. I can give you the keys to the house if you want to take a look over the weekend,” she told me.

Saturday,

Mom had offered to fly down so we could handle this together when I asked her about the genealogical side of the story, but I’d told her I would be fine, I was just checking out a house. 

Now as I pulled into the start of the driveway I wished I’d taken her up. The gravel path seemed to disappear into the trees as it went around a curve and this house deep in the valley hadn’t had any neighbors to start with. The fact that Lisa was waiting for me wasn’t reassuring.

As I rounded yet another curve and the house came into view the engine made a strange sigh and suddenly I was wrestling with an unresponsive wheel as the car jerked to a stop. I turned the key but the engine didn’t even turn. How many people know I was here, I wonder silently. Mom didn’t even know when I was going. None of these thoughts gave me comfort as I went to open the door and found it jammed. This was perfect just perfect. I was stuck locked in my car in the middle of a forest with the only one with any idea I was there quite possible out to steal everything I owned.

I gave the door another shove and felt it give slightly. With another hefty push I found myself falling out and anto the rough drive. It was a wonder that nothing scraped. Still when I stood up I was significantly worse for wear and the was still a walk to reach the door. I considered walking back, but the car wasn’t going to make itself worse. Better to give it some time. I did pop up the hood and took a good sniff, but nothing smelled burnt and everything seemed to be in order. I pulled out my phone. Better call a tow truck it will take a while to get here anyway, I decided, but it turned out I didn’t have reception. Well they’d have a phone in the house. I could call for a tow from there.

The gravel made small shifting noises as I made my way up to the door. I didn’t own a gun, but as I got closer and my nerves had yet another panic attack I kind of wished I did. Still the house was distracting enough to almost make me forget about my foreboding. First it was  big. At least three stories and it looked like there might be some rooms set into the roof, but it wasn’t by any means short and squat. It sprawled out on both side of an imposing main entrance and from far away I could glimpse
